How to Run the game Locally:

    Install Packages:
        pip install OpenAI
        pip install Flask
        pip install names


Add openAI key*:
    Create a text file and store your private OpenAI key, name the file "password.txt" 


**Please Ensure that all files are in the same directory. 


You can now run the game (run main.py)... If you would like to hardcode player names, you can do so in main.py.
