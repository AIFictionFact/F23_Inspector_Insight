Description:

A modern spin on the classic mafia game. You and your friends are each selected as members of a town, some criminals, some innocent. 
Using prompts and questions guided by lead investigator “Inspector Insight” (AI) your goal is to keep your identity concealed, all while answering questions devised to uncover the “killer”. 
If “inspector Insight” is able to correctly match your identity you lose. All players are given details that describe details of their story, such as location, alibis, and motives.

***
The program would be able to navigate and store the information given/provided during the “night” and there would be a public data set (such as who is dead) that the AI would have access to in order to generate questions and make guesses. 
Modification might need to be made to the rules and play structure of the game to accommodate a more ‘chat’ like structure.
